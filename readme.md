Orvibo S20 smart socket PHP API
=============

This code base started from [my project](https://github.com/pcp135/HomeAutomation) to control some [LimitlessLED Smart-Lights](http://limitlessled.com) bulbs through a web interface hosted on a Raspberrypi.  

Over time my project expanded to include also some [Orvibo S20](http://www.orvibo.com/en_products_view.asp?mid=15&pid=4&id=234) smart sockets for which I couldn't find any existing PHP API so wrote this one using the reverse engineered data available from various sources, particularly the [Ninja Blocks Java API](https://github.com/Grayda/ninja-allone).

Please feel free to include this code in your own projects and further develop and expand to support more of the features of the Orvibo smart sockets if you like.

Usage:
=============
   $o = new Orvibo('AC:CF:23:9C:A0:D0', '192.168.241.252', 10000);
   $o->on();
